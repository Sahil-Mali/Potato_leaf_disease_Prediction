# Potato_leaf_disease_Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for detecting and classifying potato leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can identify diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves with high accuracy. The project aims to assist farmers in early disease detection, thereby improving crop management and yield.

## Features
- **Automated Disease Detection**: Classifies potato leaves into different disease categories.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes CNNs trained on a labeled dataset.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality for better model performance.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.
- **Scalable & Deployable**: Can be integrated with mobile applications for broader accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: 
  - TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning)
  - OpenCV (Image Processing)
  - NumPy, Pandas (Data Handling)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Minimum 8GB RAM
  - GPU (Recommended for training)
  - High-resolution camera for image acquisition

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of images of potato leaves categorized as:
  - **Healthy**
  - **Early Blight**
  - **Late Blight**
- Images are preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model robustness.
